# Download YouTube Audio with Pytube

This code is a Python script that downloads the audio from a YouTube video using the `pytube` library. The script takes the URL of the video to be downloaded and filters the streams to select the one with the highest bit rate.

## Dependencies

This script requires the following dependencies:

- Python 3.6 or higher
- `pytube` library

## How to Use

To use this script, follow these steps:

1. Replace the value of the `url` variable with the URL of the YouTube video you want to download.
2. Run the script using a Python IDE or from the command line.
3. After the script finishes running, the audio from the YouTube video will be downloaded to a folder named `download` in the current directory.

If the `download` folder does not exist, the script will create it before downloading the audio file.
